Ah, so you managed to cross the Bridge of Death eh?
Did you like the jokes? 
And did you find the hidden question?
Oh good.

Anyway, look, I admire your persistence.
But it takes more than that to become an Awesome
Python Programmer.

I'm going to set you two challenges.

Firstly, I challenge you to download Python and install it on your own computer.

And then, I challenge you to download a Python script that I've written, 
and run it on your own computer.

I'll put the link to the script in the video description.

Good luck!

(In the video description: Please do not post comments asking
how to install Python or run a script. If you're stuck, ask a
friend. That's what friends are for!)

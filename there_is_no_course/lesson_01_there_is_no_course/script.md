# Episode 1 - There is no course

Oh, hi. 
Are you here for the course?
Ah, sorry, I was just kidding.
I have no idea how to teach someone to be an awesome Python programmer.
There is no course.
There are no more videos.
So don't bother trying to find any.
Because they don't exist.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by.
I'm just going to get back to work, if that's OK?

(Time passes.)

Look, I'm telling you, there is no course!
No lessons, no videos!
Oh, and whatever you do, don't push the big red button.
Bad things will happen.
You have been warned.

(Big red button link appears.)
